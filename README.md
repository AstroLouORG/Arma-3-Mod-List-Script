# Arma-3-Mod-List-Script
This script allows you to easily list all the mods installed on a server for putting it on the start.bat file, by just running the script. A lot of time saved.

How to run it:

▪️ Download Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/) and install it.

▪️ Download the Script and put it into the Arma 3 Server Folder

▪️ Edit the script using Notepad++ or any editor to your liking

▪️ Edit the line "let path = ("Arma 3 Server")" to your Arma 3 Server Path. MAKE SURE THE PATH IS IN QUOTES!

▪️ Save the File

▪️ Open the console / PowerShell in that folder.

▪️ Type "node ModScript.js"

▪️ You should now get a file called "modlist.txt"

▪️ Copy and paste that into the mod parameter of your start.bat file

▪️ You may want to put "CBA_A3, ace, Task_Force_Radio" at the very beginning of the mod parameter.

Done!
